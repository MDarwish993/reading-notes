### What does “strong typed” mean?
In Java, the term "strongly typed" refers to a programming language feature that enforces strict type checking at compile-time. This means that Java is designed to catch type-related errors before a program even runs, which can help prevent a wide range of bugs and errors that might otherwise occur during runtime.

In a strongly typed language like Java, each variable has a specific data type associated with it, and this type is known at compile-time. This allows the compiler to ensure that operations and assignments are performed only between compatible data types. For example, you cannot directly assign a string value to an integer variable without explicitly converting or casting the value.


### What are the primitive data types?

In Java, primitive data types are basic data types that represent simple values, and they are not objects. They have fixed sizes in memory and typically directly correspond to the hardware-supported data types of the underlying system. Java has eight primitive data types, which can be categorized into four groups: integer types, floating-point types, character type, and boolean type. Here's an overview of each primitive data type:

### Explain to a non-technical friend the difference in how compilation works in Java and JavaScript.
Java has a strict chef (compiler) that carefully checks your recipe (code) before you can bake (run) it.
JavaScript has a helper (interpreter) that guides you as you make the cake (run your program), and it gives you instant feedback if something goes wrong.

### Does code complining mean that it works correctly?
No, code compilation doesn't necessarily mean that the code will work correctly. Compilation is a process that converts human-readable source code into machine-executable code, but it doesn't guarantee that the program will be free of logical errors or bugs.

### How many keywords does Java have?
Java has 50 reserved keywords. These keywords have special meanings in the language and cannot be used as identifiers (such as variable names, class names, or method names). 
### How do you print words to the console in Java?
In Java, you can use the System.out.println() method to print words and other data to the console. This method belongs to the System class and is used for standard output.
