## Define the term "hashing":
Hashing is a process in computer science where a piece of data, like a password, is transformed into a fixed-length string of characters, which is typically a series of numbers and letters. This output, known as a "hash value" or simply a "hash," is generated by a mathematical function called a "hash function." The key feature of hashing is that it converts input data of any size into a unique, fixed-size output, which makes it useful for various applications, including password security.

## Explain to a non-technical friend what a hash function does to a password:
Imagine a hash function as a magical blender. You put your password into the blender, and it churns and mixes it up in a special way. What comes out is a jumbled-up mess of characters that look nothing like your original password. This jumbled mess is your password's hash. The cool thing is, no matter how long or short your password is, the hash is always the same length. So, even if you have a super long password or a short one, the blender will always give you a hash that's the same size. Hash functions are like one-way streets – you can easily turn your password into a hash, but you can't turn the hash back into your password. This makes it great for keeping passwords safe.

## What does it mean to 'salt' a password?
Salting a password is like adding a special ingredient to your secret recipe before you hash it. In the world of passwords, a "salt" is a random string of characters that gets added to your password before hashing. This extra step makes your password much more secure. Even if two people have the same password, their hashes will be different because they used different salts. So, salting makes it harder for bad guys to guess your password using precomputed tables or rainbow tables.

## What piece of information would a hacker need to access in order to find the 'salt' string for your passwords?
To find the salt for your passwords, a hacker would typically need access to your password database, which should be well-protected. If the database is poorly secured and the hacker gets in, they might find the salts along with the hashed passwords. However, salts are not meant to be secret, just unique for each user. The real secret is the password itself, which is why hashing is crucial – even if the hacker knows the salt, they still can't easily reverse-engineer your actual password.

## How does the Blowfish block cipher handle the increased computation speed of new computers?
Blowfish is designed to be adaptable to changes in computing speed. It does this by using a key expansion process that adapts to the performance of the machine it's running on. It was originally designed in the 1990s when computers were much slower than today's machines. As computers got faster, Blowfish could be adapted to use longer keys, which increased its security. So, it's like having a lock that automatically adjusts its complexity as the bad guys get better at picking locks.

## What are the issues with the two most common password hashes for Java ("Java password hash" and "Java password encryption")?
In the context of Java, "Java password hash" typically refers to simple hashing techniques like using MD5 or SHA-1. These methods are considered weak for password storage because they are fast and can be easily brute-forced or cracked using precomputed tables.

"Java password encryption" might refer to reversible encryption, where the password can be decrypted to retrieve the original value. This is also not recommended for password storage because if an attacker gains access to the encryption keys, they can easily decrypt all passwords.

Both of these approaches have significant security flaws, and it's generally recommended to use more secure and adaptive hashing algorithms like bcrypt, as it's resistant to brute-force attacks and adapts to increasing computing power, making it much more secure for storing passwords.
