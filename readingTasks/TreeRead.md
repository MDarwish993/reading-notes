# Tree

## WHY:
Understanding the concept of trees in Java can be challenging. Using an analogy can make it easier to grasp. Think of a tree in Java as a library shelf where books are organized in a hierarchical manner.

## WHAT:
In this analogy, a library shelf represents a tree in Java:

 - Root Node: Imagine the top shelf as the root node. It's where everything starts.
 - Nodes: Each shelf on the library shelf represents a node in the tree.
 - Edges: The books on each shelf represent the connections (edges) between nodes.

## HOW:
Just like in a library shelf, you can add, remove, or search for books in different ways. In Java trees:

- You can add nodes (shelves) to the tree.
- You can remove nodes from the tree.
- You can search for specific nodes (books) efficiently.

## Cheat Sheet:

- Tree: Like a library shelf, a hierarchical data structure.
- Root Node: The top shelf where everything starts.
- Nodes: Shelves on the library shelf.
- Edges: Represented by books on each shelf.
- Adding Nodes: Like adding shelves with books.
- Removing Nodes: Removing shelves.
- Searching Nodes: Efficiently finding a book on the shelf.
## Diagram/Visualization:

Imagine a library shelf with labeled shelves (nodes) and books (edges) connecting them, representing a binary search tree.

## Anthropomorphize Concepts:

Imagine a conversation between two nodes:

- Node A: "I'm your left child."
- Node B: "And I'm your right child."
