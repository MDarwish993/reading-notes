# Hash Tables

**WHAT is a Hash Table?**
A hash table, also known as a hash map, is a data structure used to store key-value pairs. It allows you to efficiently retrieve a value associated with a given key. Think of it as a dictionary where you can quickly look up the meaning (value) of a word (key).

**WHY use Hash Tables?**
Hash tables are incredibly useful because they provide fast and constant-time average lookup, insertion, and deletion of key-value pairs. This means that you can access the data you need in a fraction of a second, regardless of the size of the dataset. They are commonly used in various applications such as databases, caches, and even in programming languages for symbol tables.

**HOW do Hash Tables work?**
1. **Hash Function**:
   - The core of a hash table is a hash function. This function takes a key as input and returns an index (usually an integer) where the corresponding value should be stored.

2. **Array (Bucket)**:
   - The hash table is typically implemented as an array (sometimes called a bucket). Each element in this array corresponds to a possible index generated by the hash function.

3. **Storing Key-Value Pairs**:
   - When you want to add a key-value pair to the hash table, the hash function is applied to the key, which determines where in the array the value should be stored.

4. **Collision Handling**:
   - Collisions occur when two keys result in the same index. Hash tables need a mechanism to handle this situation. Common collision resolution strategies include chaining (each index holds a linked list of key-value pairs) and open addressing (finding the next available slot in the array).

5. **Retrieving Values**:
   - To retrieve a value for a given key, the hash function is applied to the key, and the index is computed. Then, the table looks up the corresponding index and returns the associated value.

6. **Deletion and Updating**:
   - Deletion and updating also involve finding the index through the hash function and then modifying or removing the key-value pair from the appropriate slot.

7. **Load Factor**:
   - To maintain efficient performance, it's important to monitor the load factor (the ratio of the number of stored elements to the number of available slots). If it becomes too high, the hash table may need to be resized to avoid excessive collisions.
