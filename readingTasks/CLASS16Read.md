## Authentication:
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity trying to access a system. In the context of Spring Security, it means confirming that the user is who they claim to be. Authentication is typically done by verifying the user's credentials, such as a username and password.

## Authorization:
Authorization comes after authentication. Once a user is authenticated, authorization determines what actions or resources that user is allowed to access within the application. It defines the permissions and privileges granted to authenticated users based on their roles, attributes, or other criteria.

## Possible Outcomes of the AuthenticationManager's authenticate() Method:

### - Successful Authentication:

If the authentication process succeeds (i.e., the user provides valid credentials), the authenticate() method returns an Authentication object that represents the authenticated user. This object typically includes information about the user and their granted authorities.

### - Failed Authentication:

If the authentication process fails (e.g., due to incorrect credentials), the authenticate() method may throw an exception or return a special Authentication object indicating the authentication failure. The specific behavior can be configured in Spring Security.

### - Exception During Authentication:

In some cases, an unexpected exception might occur during the authentication process, such as a database connection error or a runtime exception. When this happens, the authenticate() method may throw an exception to indicate the problem.

## basic structure and configuration needed to secure a web application using Spring Security:
### Step 1: Set up a user model and repo

This step involves defining a user model and a repository to interact with the user data in the database. It's a fundamental part of any authentication system.
### Step 2: Create a controller for that model

A controller is necessary to handle user requests related to authentication and authorization. It's responsible for routing and processing incoming requests.
### Step 3: UserDetailsServiceImpl implements UserDetailsService

UserDetailsService is an interface provided by Spring Security for loading user-specific data. The UserDetailsServiceImpl class should implement this interface and retrieve user information from the database based on their username. This step is crucial for authentication.
### Step 4: ApplicationUser implements UserDetails

ApplicationUser is a class that implements the UserDetails interface. This step involves implementing the required methods. Making the boolean methods return true typically means granting all permissions by default. However, you can customize this behavior based on your application's requirements and security model.
### Step 5: WebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter

WebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter to configure Spring Security. In this step:
UserDetailsService and passwordEncoder beans are configured.
configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) method configures the authentication manager to use the UserDetailsService and password encoder.
configure(HttpSecurity http) method configures the security settings, including URL matching, login/logout settings, and more.
### Step 6: Registration page

This step involves creating a registration page with a form for user registration. Ensure that the form posts data to an endpoint handled by your controller. Additionally, it's suggested to add auto-login functionality for a smooth user experience.
### Step 7: Login page

Similar to the registration page, create a login page with a form that posts data to the specified route configured in the WebSecurityConfig. This step completes the authentication process.
