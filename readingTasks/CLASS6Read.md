### Difference between an Object and a Class in Java:
In Java, a class is like a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. It defines the properties (fields) and methods that objects of that class will have. An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. It's a tangible representation created based on the class blueprint. You can think of a class as a recipe, and an object as the dish you create using that recipe.

### Concept of Inheritance in Java:
Imagine you have a collection of different animals. Each animal has some common traits and behaviors, but also some unique ones. In Java, inheritance allows you to create a new class (subclass or derived class) based on an existing class (superclass or base class). The new class inherits the attributes and behaviors of the existing class. It's like a family tree where the child inherits features from their parents. This helps in reusing code, organizing classes, and creating a hierarchy of related classes.

### Java Static Keyword:
Static methods are also called class methods. They are associated with the class itself rather than with instances of the class. This means you can call them using the class name, without creating an object of that class. They are often used for utility functions that don't require instance-specific data.

You can access a static variable of a class without instantiating an object because static variables belong to the class itself, not to individual instances. They are shared among all instances of the class. So, you can access them using the class name.

### Java Singleton Class:
A design pattern is a general solution to a recurring problem. In programming, it's a template or guideline for solving specific problems. An example from your work experience could be comparing a template you use for structuring emails in a consistent way.

A singleton is a design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. Imagine a CEO's office key - no matter how many employees there are, they all share the same key to the CEO's office. In programming, a singleton ensures that only one instance of a class is created and provides a way to access it.
