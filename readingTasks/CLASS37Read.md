# Introduction to Amazon S3

## What is Amazon S3?
Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is a scalable cloud storage solution provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows users to store and retrieve data at any time from anywhere on the web.

## Features offered by Amazon S3:
1. **Scalability:** S3 can scale virtually infinitely, accommodating any amount of data without worrying about capacity constraints.
2. **Durability and Reliability:** It ensures high durability by replicating data across multiple servers within AWS regions.
3. **Security:** S3 provides robust security features, including access control mechanisms, encryption, and identity management.

## What is an object key?
An object key in Amazon S3 is a unique identifier assigned to each object (file) stored in a bucket. It's akin to a file path in a file system, enabling easy retrieval and organization of data within the bucket.
