# The Command Line Task:
1- The Command Line:
In this segment, you will learn about the command line interface (CLI), its purpose, and how to access it. The command line allows you to interact with your computer through text-based commands. You will learn how to open the terminal on your operating system (Linux, macOS, Windows).

2-Basic Navigation:
This section introduces you to navigating the Linux directory structure using command line commands. Key commands include:

pwd: Print working directory
ls: List files and directories
cd: Change directory
mkdir: Make a new directory
More About Files:
Here, you will explore additional details about files and directories in a Linux environment. Learn about file permissions (chmod), file ownership (chown), and special directories like . (current directory) and .. (parent directory).

3- Manual Pages:
You'll discover how to use the manual pages (man pages) to get detailed information about various commands. By typing man followed by a command name (e.g., man ls), you can access a comprehensive manual that explains the command's usage, options, and examples.

4- File Manipulation:
This segment covers various file manipulation tasks:

Creating files and directories using touch and mkdir
Removing files and directories using rm and rmdir
Renaming and moving files using mv
Copying files and directories using cp

5- Cheat Sheet:
The cheat sheet provides a quick reference summarizing the main points covered in the tutorial. It's a useful reference for the commands and concepts you've learned.

As you work through these segments, make sure to practice the commands in your terminal. Document your observations, any challenges you faced, and "aha" moments. Once you've completed all the activities, create a summary of your learnings and observations, highlighting any key takeaways from each segment. This will serve as your submission for the assignment.
